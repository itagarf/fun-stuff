# fun-stuff :see_no_evil:

I came across some easter egg hidden in Python modules and I decided to try them out and keep them here in my repo:grinning:

I also stumbled across a [git repository](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) showing how to include different emojis to your repo. So I said why not steal some in here :woman_shrugging:?

My favourite emoji: :smirk: <br>
My trying-to-be-annoying emoji: :smiling_imp:

Okay done! :running_woman:
